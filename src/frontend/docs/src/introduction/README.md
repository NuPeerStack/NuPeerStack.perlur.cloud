# NuPeerStack Introduction

**NuPeerStack** is a project that aims to build decentralized, permission-less and censorship resistant alternative to [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) by combining the latest from Blockchain, Distributed Systems, Open Hardware and Peer-to-Peer Networking technologies.

## Philosophy
In order to build permission-less, trust-less and trully decentralized end-to-emd secure platform, available to the masses on peer-to-peer basis, several treams among different disciplines of human enterpreneurship need to converge, and synchronize.

To enable open source, open hardware, open access, permision-less and decentralized future for all, we work with our partners and build a hybrid platform that uses decentralized technology where it is currently feasible, yet enables out-sourcing of different components of the full stack, such as compute, to a trusted, centralized counter-party until such point that peer-to-peer alternative becomes available.
