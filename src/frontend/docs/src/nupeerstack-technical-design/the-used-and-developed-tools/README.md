# The Used and Developed Tools

## Programming Language of Choice
We have chosen to use mainly [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the tools we develop ourselves, unless there is a strong technical reason to use different tool, that is for systems level programming; for front-end development we use [Vue.js TypeScript](https://vuejs.org/). In addition, we also contribute significantly to existing open-source and free-software tools; to those we contribute in their programming original languages.
