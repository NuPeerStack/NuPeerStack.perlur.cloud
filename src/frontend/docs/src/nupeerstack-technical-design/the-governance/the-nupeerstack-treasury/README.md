# The NuPeerStack Treasury

To ensure stability, longevity and growth of **NuPeerStack** ecosystem, **NuPeerStack** has its own treasury which manages a variety of assets from different fungible tokens such as $IaaS, $PaaS and $SaaS tokens, stablecoin tokens and tokens of other projects that **NuPeerStack** utilizes ($ADA, $STORJ,...).

In addition to different fungible tokens, **NuPeerStack** Treasury also owns fractions of non-fungible tokens which represent the securitized intellectual property royalty rights which provide a regular, recurring revenue stream for **NuPeerStack** Treasury, thus creating a positive feedback loop.

Assets in **NuPeerStack** Treasury are allocated based on current and anticipated needs and risks. Treasury will utilize decentralized exchange to rebalance itâ€™s assets portfolio as the needs keep evolving in the ever changing business environment. As new risks emerge or as they disappear. The allocation targets can be both automated and human decision driven based on their nature, e.q. legal risks may be primarily human decision driven, while infrastructure costs may be algorithm driven with minimal human influence.
