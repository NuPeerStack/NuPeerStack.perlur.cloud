# The Smart Contracts

Just like Cardano with Marlowe, which is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to enable experts in domain of the financial contracts to write financial contracts without knowledge of general purpose programming; at **NuPeerStack** we understand that managed IT services / cloud services are governed by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between customers, suppliers, and among suppliers themselves.

Thus we take inspiration from Cardano, and design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to enable actors within our ecosystem to sign Service Level Agreements between themselves, when properly composed, these ensure predictanble revenue, costs and service level quality for the end customers, and infrastructure providers, as well as system administrators.

## How does a typical SLA look like?
