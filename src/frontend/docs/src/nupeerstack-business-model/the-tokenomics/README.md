# The Tokenomics

## Fungible Tokens

## Non-Fungible Tokens

### Executive Roles NFTs

Holders of executive role tokens may, or may not be limited in their term, depending on the character of the respective role, however each executive role token may be revoked if the executive loses the support of the community. Each executive role token validity is directly tied to the voting power which supports the individual executive role NFT instance.

Exact game-theory mechanics are yet to be researched and defined, however it is already decided, that [fungible tokens](#fungible-tokens) holders will be able to revoke their support for any given executive role NFT instance (de-facto elected executive). If support from community drops below certain threshold new executive will have to be elected and new instance of respective executive role NFT will be issued and given to newly elected representative.

For each executive proposal made by an elected executive representative, based on the proposal classification period of time and different thresholds will be assigned so that the community of $NEWM token owners can vote in favour or against any specific proposal. For certain types of proposals, especially those with legal impacts, agreement of several elected executive representatives may change quorum requirements in either direction, or votes casted by elected executive representatives may have different weighting.

For instance, the Chief Legal Officerâ€™s proposal to settle a lawsuit if supported by 50% of other elected executive representatives may require 90% of the community participating in the vote to vote against the proposal with at least 50% quorum in order for the proposal not to be executed by the respective smart-contract.
