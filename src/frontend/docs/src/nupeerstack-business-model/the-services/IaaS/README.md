# Infrastructure as a Service
Using software deployed on wide range of commodity hardware, **Infrastructure as a Service** is the primary component of any true public cloud platform, it is the first level of abstraction of so-called bare metal hardware. Within these high level service categories, other specific sub-services are hiding, serving different use-cases. When composed together, a complete application can be deployed and managed throughout it's lifecycle, including seamless use by the end-users.

These services together create a service catalogue, from which a Solution Architect selects individual services, which are required to enable the given use-case higher up the service stack, or given application.
